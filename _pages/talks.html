Information and Decision Making - IDEM
======
* Outline: This research undertakes fundamental research in applied mathematics at the intersection of information theory, 
  game theory and machine learning. Specifically, a dynamic zero-sum game-theoretic model is proposed for the machine learning applications, 
  such as adversarial learning, in which the attacker observes the behaviour of algorithms subjecting to distortion. 
  Furthermore, the connection between the capacity of the observation channel and the corresponding game utility is established. 
  This research is supported by the Exploratory Action of INRIA.

Collaborator: Dr. Samir M. Perlaza, Dr. Alain Jean-Marie

aRTIFICIAL iNTELLIGENCE for the Deaf - aID
======
*  Outline: This research undertakes undertakes to elaborate the development of Bayesian ML networks, development of new compression methods and
  algorithms for Bayesian ML techniques based on information theoretic arguments.
  This research is supported by the Action of the H2020-MGA-MSCA RISE.

  Collaborator: Prof. S. Theodoridis, Dr. K. Panousis
